# A Very Simple Http Proxy Server

There are two components in this project:
## A Http Proxy Server which provides Proxy Service with SSL enabled.
## A Client Side Agent which connects to the Proxy Server and provide a non-SSL local service.

This is super simple which can work in real world. It is a demostration of how a forward proxy works. 
There is no performance optimization, nor NIO, so it may not able to handle massive connections.
